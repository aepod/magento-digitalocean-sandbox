##Overview
The download_file module allows you to download files on Windows

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opentable/puppet-download_file.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opentable/puppet-download_file)

##Module Description

The download_file module introduced a small define `download_file` that will allow you to download a file over http(s) for usage during an installation.
This was created because the package resource does not support http as a source for packages.
It is only supported on Windows.

##Setup
###What download_file affects
* Downloads files onto each node

###Setup Requirements
* download_file makes use of Powershell so you will need to have at least version 2.0 installed in order to use this module.

##Begining

To download dotnet 4.0

```puppet
    download_file { "Download dotnet 4.0" :
      url                   => 'http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/A/95A9616B-7A37-4AF6-BC36-D6EA96C8DAAE/dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe',
      destination_directory => 'c:\temp'
    }
```

To download dotnet 4.0 using a proxy

```puppet
    download_file { "Download dotnet 4.0" :
      url                   => 'http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/A/95A9616B-7A37-4AF6-BC36-D6EA96C8DAAE/dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe',
      destination_directory => 'c:\temp',
      proxyAddress          => 'http://corporateproxy.net:8080'
    }
```

The proxy will be used as part of the download using PowerShell. This does not set a system wide proxy
